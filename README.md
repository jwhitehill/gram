 Requirements
-------------------

- R environment for statistical computing <https://www.r-project.org/>
- data.table package <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html>


  Running the code
-------------------

The script run_experiments.R runs all the experiments presented in
sections 6.1 and 6.2 of the article.

The function EM in the lib.R file implements the GRAM model, with 
parameters:

  - d_train <data.frame>      Data frame containing the training set.
  - Niter <numeric>           Number of iterations to run the EM algorithm.
  - V <numeric>               Standard deviation of the prior distribution 
			      of the educational resources quality.
  - U <numeric>               Mean of the prior distribution of the educational 
			      resources quality.
  - EPS <numeric>	      Small additive factor to avoid numerical problems.
  - useMu <numeric>	      Indicates how to estimate the mean in the EM 
			      algorithm:
				-- 1, as defined by the EM algorithm
				-- else, mu is set to 0 
  - sigmaType <string>	      Indicates how to estimate the standard deviation 
			      in the EM algorithm: 
				-- "sigma", as defined by the EM algorithm 
				-- "pretest", using pretest scores only
				-- else, standard deviation is set to 1
  - verbose <numeric>         Indicates whether to print (1) or not (0) the 
			      Spearman and Pearson correlation at each EM iteration.
  - verbose_pval <numeric>    Indicates whether to print (1) or not (0) the 
			      p-values of the correlations.
